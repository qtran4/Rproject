# 1. In which country (X or Y) did the disease outbreak likely begin?
#ANSWER: 
# Based on above plots, the diseases has started earlier in the country X (approx. 
# from the 122 days), whereas the diseases has diagnosed a bit later on country Y
# (approx. after 138 days). Thus, the disease outbrerak likely to begin in country X.

# 2. If Country Y develops a vaccine for the disease, is it likely to work for
# citizens of Country X?
# ANSWER: From the above graph, we can see that marker 1-marker4 are mostly present
# in country X, whereas marker 6 to 10 are present in abundance in country Y. Not same
# vaccine will work for both countries if we need to eradicated the disease completely.
# If both countries had same marker, a vaccine develoved by country Y could have eradicated
# the disease even in country X.

####SOME ANSWERS FROM 3rd FUNCTION####
# kind of summary
# Number of screens run is 39888, which can be seen in console.
# Patients diagnosed as infected is 0.57 %.
# Percentage of male vs. female patients is 1.002
# Age distribution of patients is minimum=1 year, maximum=423 year with median and mean 8 and 12.72, respectively
# The maximum age range of 423 years seems weird to me!!
